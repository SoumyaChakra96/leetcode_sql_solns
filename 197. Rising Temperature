select w1.id
from weather w1, weather w2
where datediff(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
and w2.temperature  < w1.temperature;

# we have to join the table with itself only (self join) and dente 1st occurance as w1 and the second occurance as w2, 
then we have to filter using datediff function to compare if two dates are consecutive dates i.e equal to 1,
and then we have to comapare if temperature of a particular date is greater than it's previous date or not i(we have to check it for all the dates),
and finally return the w1.
